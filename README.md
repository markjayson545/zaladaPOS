## Getting Started

Welcome to the Zalada POS system project. This guide will help you get started with writing Java code in Visual Studio Code for this project.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains the following folders:

- `src`: the folder to maintain source code
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> To customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
